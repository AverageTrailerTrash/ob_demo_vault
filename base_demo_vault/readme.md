This vault will include just the base logic needed for managing a category-id system that utilizes folders and metadata in Obsidian.

## Coming Next
* ~~fixing the incorrect folder structure & naming conventions~~ ✓
* ~~reconfiguring functions to use dataview API to improve performance & enable blind IDs.~~ ✓
* adding debug notices to all functions; skimped on this in the last push because I was experimenting & unsure what would stick
* reconfiguring things again to take *full* advantage of dv... I want to minimize file manipulation for efficiency and ensure files can be found regardless of folder structure.

## Coming Soon 
These need to be converted from my personal vault into a more standard format.
* various for accessing categories
* various for handling folders
* addNewCategory
* removeCategory
* various for building modular blocks in templates, like adding basic metadata

Associated templates may be added alongside them, or a bit later. Need to make sure the naming structure is solid beforehand.

## Coming Later
* various for editing config settings
* various for converting existing tags & folders to new or existing categories
* renameCategory - discouraged but needs to exist for edge cases
* mergeCategories - \^
* changeFileCategory - \^
