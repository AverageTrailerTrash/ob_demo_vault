This vault will include just the base logic needed for managing a category-id system that utilizes folders and metadata in Obsidian.

## Major Functions Coming Next 
These need to be converted from my personal vault into a more standard format.
* various for accessing categories
* various for handling folders
* addNewCategory
* removeCategory
* various for building modular blocks in templates, like adding basic metadata

Associated templates may be added alongside them, or a bit later. Need to make sure the naming structure is solid beforehand.

## Major Functions Coming Later
* various for editing config settings
* various for converting existing tags & folders to new or existing categories
* renameCategory - discouraged but needs to exist for edge cases
* mergeCategories - \^
* changeFileCategory - \^
