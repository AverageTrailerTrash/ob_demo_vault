# The Basics
Besides the principles covered in the readme, this whole system is based on a few simple organizational ideas: 

* Similar types of files are stored together in one folder. **HOW**: This is based on how they are used, not just their file type or the associated project. **WHY**: For ease of locating files, for computational efficiency, for enhancing memory through categorical connections, and for the interdisciplinary use of our assets and knowledge.

For example, notes on fictional locations may be split into two separate storage areas based on whether they are your own locations or those from pop culture.

* These file groups are assigned a category with an ID of a set character length, and the individual files in them are assigned a UID in a category-number format. 

For the above example, we may have file "lct/LCT99 - Mordor from LOTR" and file "loc/LOC99 - Place from My World". Two different categories with different IDs, stored in different places.

* Everything that can be separated into its own file eventually is. These files and the content within them is not duplicated elsewhere, except in brief mentions that link to the source information where mistakes will be quickly noticed.

If we wanted to add some information about how LOC99 and LOC215 were related to each other, we'd make a new "relationship" type file connected to both, rather than the repeating information. Say, say "rel/REL776 - Place A & Place B".

* Certain exceptions to file placement and naming conventions are made where functionally necessary, psychologically beneficial, or otherwise appropriate.
