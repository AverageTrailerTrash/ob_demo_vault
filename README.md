# ob_demo_vault
This will contain an Obsidian vault that demonstrates the category &amp; automation systems I'm already using and continuing to develop. It may also include some secondary applets I use to manage my file system and further enhance Obsidian, plus general tips and documentation.

It's in the very early stages; if you're peeking in before any proper releases, expect things to break.

## Status: 

* Does **not** have all the base scripts and templates needed for new users to get started. 

* Currently working on rebuilding the scripts to use the Dataview API for greater efficiency.

## Primary Use

This setup is designed with creative work and general organization in mind.

It's based on the following principles:

* **Permanence**: What we care about should have a permanent identity and place to live.
* **Interopability**: Programs should be able to interact with each other & the broader system.
* **Flexibility**: Our notes and systems shouldn't be locked into someone else's templates.
* **Automatism**: We should be able to work on our projects in a comfortable flow state.
* **Efficiency**: We should minimize repetitive busy work we find unpleasant or distracting.

## Contents
* **base_demo_vault**: This will include just the base scripts, folders, etc. needed to implement the category-ID system, including tools to convert existing vaults.
* **main_demo_vault**: This will include additional systems that balance out the structure of the category-ID system with tools for more freeform note creation.
* **life_demo_vault**: This will include many additional systems that I think would be useful for the average individual to handle their daily life and activities.
* **individual_packages**: This will include each system from the other vaults & more as separate add-ons that can be installed to any vault based on this struture. 
* **java_applet**: This will include a small program for desktop users that helps Obsidian vaults based on this structure communicate with the rest of your computer.
* **documentation**: This will include documentation and tips for running this system, its add-ons, and extending it for your own use cases.

I recommend starting with the main vault and adding packages over time. 

Jumping into a whole new homekeeping & productivity system at once can be overwhelming.
