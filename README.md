# ob_demo_vault
This will contain an Obsidian vault that demonstrates the category &amp; automation systems I'm already using and continuing to develop. It may also include some secondary applets I use to manage my file system and further enhance Obsidian, plus general tips and documentation.

It's in the very early stages; if you're peeking in before any proper releases, expect things to break.

## Required Plugins
This list will be added to over time as I flesh out the system.
* **Templater**: allows us to run js from templates
* **CustomJS**: allows us to break js into reusable functions
* **Advanced URI**: link notes from external tools & run commands from links

**Core Plugins**: File Explorer, Quick Switcher, Search, Templates

## Recommended Plugins

* **Recent Files**: quickly access recent files from sidebar
* **Various Complements**: IDE-style autofill / text suggestions

Any CSS snippets I include will be based on this theme.
